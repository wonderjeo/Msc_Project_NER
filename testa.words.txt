Egypt has released from custody 163 more members of the Muslim Brotherhood .
More than 700 members of the banned opposition group were arrested during protests last month .
Despite Sunday release , the movement 's main leaders and hundreds more are still behind bars .
In May , the Muslim Brotherhood staged a series of protests over an amendment to Egypt 's constitution .
The amendment , which has since been approved , allows more than one candidate to run in presidential elections .
The Brotherhood protested the measure because it also included tough conditions for independent candidates , effectively excluding those not approved by the ruling party .
Opposition leaders said the amendment ensures there will be no serious challenges to President Hosni Mubarak .
Norway 's Catholic Church has revealed that a bishop who resigned last year had admitted to allegations of child molestation committed about 20 years ago .
German-born Georg Mueller stepped down as bishop in the western city of Trondheim in June 2009 .
Church officials gave vague reasons for his resignation at the time .
His successor , Bishop Bernt Eidsvig , told reporters Mueller confessed to abusing a choir boy as soon as he was confronted with the accusation .
Eidsvig said details of the abuse had not been released earlier at the request of the victim .
He said the church did not report the case to police because it was too old to be prosecuted in Norway due to a statute of limitations .
The news of the abuse by Mueller is the latest in a string of pedophilia scandals in the Catholic Church worldwide , including in Pope Benedict 's native Germany .

Settled by Norwegian and Celtic ( Scottish and Irish ) immigrants during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D. , Iceland boasts the world 's oldest functioning legislative assembly , the Althing , established in 930 .
Independent for over 300 years , Iceland was subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark .
Fallout from the Askja volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused widespread famine .
Over the next quarter century , 20 % of the island 's population emigrated , mostly to Canada and the US .
Limited home rule from Denmark was granted in 1874 and complete independence attained in 1944 .
The second half of the 20th century saw substantial economic growth driven primarily by the fishing industry .
The economy diversified greatly after the country joined the European Economic Area in 1994 , but Iceland was especially hard hit by the global financial crisis in the years following 2008 .
Literacy , longevity , and social cohesion are first rate by world standards .
The Paracel Islands are surrounded by productive fishing grounds and by potential oil and gas reserves .
In 1932 , French Indochina annexed the islands and set up a weather station on Pattle Island ; maintenance was continued by its successor , Vietnam .
China has occupied the Paracel Islands since 1974 , when its troops seized a South Vietnamese garrison occupying the western islands .
China built a military installation on Woody Island with an airfield and artificial harbor .
The islands also are claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam .
Two British attempts at establishing the island as a penal colony ( 1788 - 1814 and 1825 - 55 ) were ultimately abandoned .
In 1856 , the island was resettled by Pitcairn Islanders , descendants of the Bounty mutineers and their Tahitian companions .
The Netherlands economy is noted for stable industrial relations , moderate unemployment and inflation , a sizable current account surplus , and an important role as a European transportation hub .
Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing , chemicals , petroleum refining , and electrical machinery .
A highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2 % of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports .
The Netherlands , along with 11 of its EU partners , began circulating the euro currency on 1 January 2002 .
The country has been one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the US .
After 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth , the Netherlands ' economy - which is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services - was hard-hit by global economic crisis .
Dutch GDP contracted 3.9 % in 2009 , while exports declined nearly 25 % due to a sharp contraction in world demand .
The Dutch financial sector has also suffered , due in part to the high exposure of some Dutch banks to U.S. mortgage-backed securities .
In response to turmoil in financial markets , the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars into a third , to prevent further systemic risk .
The government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs , offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers , and expanding export credit facilities .
The stimulus programs and bank bailouts , however , resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6 % of GDP in 2009 and 5.3 % in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7 % of GDP in 2008 .
With unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption , the government of Prime Minister Mark RUTTE is likely to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while promoting economic recovery .
Oman is a middle-income economy that is heavily dependent on dwindling oil resources .
Because of declining reserves , Muscat has actively pursued a development plan that focuses on diversification , industrialization , and privatization , with the objective of reducing the oil sector 's contribution to GDP to 9 % by 2020 .
Tourism and gas-based industries are key components of the government 's diversification strategy .
By using enhanced oil recovery techniques , Oman succeeded in increasing oil production , giving the country more time to diversify , and the increase in global oil prices throughout 2010 provides the government greater financial resources to invest in non-oil sectors .

Although the country has been independent from the USSR since 1991 , Russian forces have remained on Moldovan territory east of the Dniester River supporting the Slavic majority population , mostly Ukrainians and Russians , who have proclaimed a " Transnistria " republic .
One of the poorest nations in Europe , Moldova became the first former Soviet state to elect a Communist , Vladimir VORONIN , as its president in 2001 .
VORONIN served as Moldova 's president until he resigned in September 2009 , following the opposition 's gain of a narrow majority in July parliamentary elections and the Communist Party 's ( PCRM ) subsequent inability to attract the three-fifths of parliamentary votes required to elect a president .

AN ASS feeding in a meadow saw a Wolf approaching to seize him , and immediately pretended to be lame .
The Wolf , coming up , inquired the cause of his lameness .
The Ass replied that passing through a hedge he had trod with his foot upon a sharp thorn .
He requested that the Wolf pull it out , lest when he ate him it should injure his throat .

International donors meeting in Oslo , Norway have pledged about four-point-five billion dollars in aid to rebuild southern Sudan after 21 years of civil war .
The United States pledged $ 1.7 billion over the next two years .
However , U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick said Tuesday the aid is dependent on Sudan ending a separate conflict in its western Darfur region .
He said the violence in Darfur casts a dangerous shadow over all of Sudan .
The United Nations estimates that the fighting in Darfur between pro-government Arab militias and rebels has left "1,80,000" people dead and more than two million others displaced .
Those aid donations made in Oslo Tuesday and Monday will go to help humanitarian and rebuilding efforts in southern Sudan , following a peace deal between the government and southern rebels earlier this year .

He promised the United Nations would do a better job than it has in the past .
U.S. pro-immigrant groups are calling for a nationwide boycott May 1 to pressure Congress into granting illegal aliens the right to gain citizenship .
On that Monday , immigrants and supporters of immigrants ' rights plan to stay home from work or school and refrain from buying or selling anything .
The plans come after immigrants and immigrants ' rights supporters held demonstrations across the nation in recent weeks .

The House of Representatives has passed legislation that would make it a felony to be an illegal immigrant , and heavily penalize companies hiring them .
The death of a pope immediately sets into motion a series of historic rituals for the mourning of the death of the leader of the Roman Catholic church .
To verify the pope 's death , the head of the Sacred College of Cardinals stands over the deceased and calls the pontiff by his baptismal name three times .
If there is no response , he announces the death and arranges for the Papal ring , known as the ring of the fisherman , and the papal seal both to be broken .
Upon news of the pontiff 's death , church bells in Rome and throughout Italy begin tolling .
The shutters on the pope 's private apartment and the massive bronze doors beneath a portico off Saint Peter 's Square are closed .

Russia is voicing surprise at the White House move to withdraw a bilateral civilian nuclear cooperation agreement from consideration by Congress .
The Russian Foreign Ministry , in a statement Tuesday , called President George Bush 's move to withdraw the deal from congressional consideration wrong , and in Moscow 's words , " politicized .
" Mr. Bush sent a withdrawal message to Congress Monday , in response to Russia 's military incursion into Georgia last month .
He called Russia 's action " incompatible with peaceful relations with its sovereign and democratic neighbor .
" The president said he could re-submit the deal to Congress for its approval , if circumstances change in Georgia .
Moscow and Washington signed the nuclear cooperation deal earlier this year .
It would have allowed U.S. and Russian companies to enter joint ventures in the nuclear industry .
Business analysts say the deal could have been worth billions of dollars .
Unique among African countries , the ancient Ethiopian monarchy maintained its freedom from colonial rule with the exception of a short-lived Italian occupation from 1936 - 41 .
In 1974 , a military junta , the Derg , deposed Emperor Haile SELASSIE ( who had ruled since 1930 ) and established a socialist state .
Torn by bloody coups , uprisings , wide-scale drought , and massive refugee problems , the regime was finally toppled in 1991 by a coalition of rebel forces , the Ethiopian People 's Revolutionary Democratic Front ( EPRDF ) .
A constitution was adopted in 1994 , and Ethiopia 's first multiparty elections were held in 1995 .
A border war with Eritrea late in the 1990s ended with a peace treaty in December 2000 .
In November 2007 , the Eritrea-Ethiopia Border Commission remotely demarcated the border by geographical coordinates , but final demarcation of the boundary on the ground is currently on hold because of Ethiopian objections to an international commission 's finding requiring it to surrender territory considered sensitive to Ethiopia .
Belize was the site of several Mayan city states until their decline at the end of the first millennium A.D. The British and Spanish disputed the region in the 17th and 18th centuries ; it formally became the colony of British Honduras in 1854 .
Territorial disputes between the UK and Guatemala delayed the independence of Belize until 1981 .
Guatemala refused to recognize the new nation until 1992 and the two countries are involved in an ongoing border dispute .
Guatemala and Belize plan to hold a simultaneous referendum to determine if this dispute will go before the International Court of Justice at The Hague , though they have not yet set a date .

The region of present day Georgia contained the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Kartli-Iberia .
The area came under Roman influence in the first centuries A.D .
and Christianity became the state religion in the 330s .
Domination by Persians , Arabs , and Turks was followed by a Georgian golden age ( 11th - 13th centuries ) that was cut short by the Mongol invasion of 1236 .
Subsequently , the Ottoman and Persian empires competed for influence in the region .
Georgia was absorbed into the Russian Empire in the 19th century .
Independent for three years ( 1918 - 1921 ) following the Russian revolution , it was forcibly incorporated into the USSR until the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991 .
An attempt by the incumbent Georgian government to manipulate national legislative elections in November 2003 touched off widespread protests that led to the resignation of Eduard SHEVARDNADZE , president since 1995 .
New elections in early 2004 swept Mikheil SAAKASHVILI into power along with his United National Movement party .
Progress on market reforms and democratization has been made in the years since independence , but this progress has been complicated by Russian assistance and support to the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
After a series of Russian and separatist provocations in summer 2008 , Georgian military action in South Ossetia in early August led to a Russian military response that not only occupied the breakaway areas , but large portions of Georgia proper as well .
Russian troops pulled back from most occupied Georgian territory , but in late August 2008 Russia unilaterally recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
This action was strongly condemned by most of the world 's nations and international organizations .
A large body of recent oceanographic research has shown that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current ( ACC ) , an ocean current that flows from west to east around Antarctica , plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation .
The region where the cold waters of the ACC meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border - the Antarctic Convergence - which fluctuates with the seasons , but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region .
The Convergence concentrates nutrients , which promotes marine plant life , and which in turn allows for a greater abundance of animal life .
In the spring of 2000 , the International Hydrographic Organization decided to delimit the waters within the Convergence as a fifth world ocean - the Southern Ocean - by combining the southern portions of the Atlantic Ocean , Indian Ocean , and Pacific Ocean .
The Southern Ocean extends from the coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude , which coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit and which approximates the extent of the Antarctic Convergence .
As such , the Southern Ocean is now the fourth largest of the world 's five oceans ( after the Pacific Ocean , Atlantic Ocean , and Indian Ocean , but larger than the Arctic Ocean ) .
It should be noted that inclusion of the Southern Ocean does not imply recognition of this feature as one of the world 's primary oceans by the US Government .
Although sighted by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1493 and claimed for Spain , it was the Dutch who occupied the island in 1631 and set about exploiting its salt deposits .
The Spanish retook the island in 1633 , but continued to be harassed by the Dutch .
The Spanish finally relinquished the island of Saint Martin to the French and Dutch , who divided it amongst themselves in 1648 .
The establishment of cotton , tobacco , and sugar plantations dramatically expanded slavery on the island in the 18th and 19th centuries ; the practice was not abolished in the Dutch half until 1863 .
The island 's economy declined until 1939 when it became a free port ; the tourism industry was dramatically expanded beginning in the 1950s .
In 1954 , Sint Maarten and several other Dutch Caribbean possessions became part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands as the Netherlands Antilles .
In a 2000 referendum , the citizens of Sint Maarten voted to become a self-governing country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands .
The change in status became effective in October of 2010 with the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles .
AN ASS , having put on the Lion 's skin , roamed about in the forest and amused himself by frightening all the foolish animals he met in his wanderings .
At last coming upon a Fox , he tried to frighten him also , but the Fox no sooner heard the sound of his voice than he exclaimed , " I might possibly have been frightened myself , if I had not heard your bray .
" Clothes may disguise a fool , but his words will give him away A CROW having stolen a bit of meat , perched in a tree and held it in her beak .
A Fox , seeing this , longed to possess the meat himself , and by a wily stratagem succeeded .
" How handsome is the Crow , " he exclaimed , in the beauty of her shape and in the fairness of her complexion ! Oh , if her voice were only equal to her beauty , she would deservedly be considered the Queen of Birds ! " This he said deceitfully ; but the Crow , anxious to refute the reflection cast upon her voice , set up a loud caw and dropped the flesh .
The Fox quickly picked it up , and thus addressed the Crow : " My good Crow , your voice is right enough , but your wit is wanting .
" A MAN had two dogs : a Hound , trained to assist him in his sports , and a Housedog , taught to watch the house .
When he returned home after a good day 's sport , he always gave the Housedog a large share of his spoil .
The Hound , feeling much aggrieved at this , reproached his companion , saying , " It is very hard to have all this labor , while you , who do not assist in the chase , luxuriate on the fruits of my exertions .
" The Housedog replied , " Do not blame me , my friend , but find fault with the master , who has not taught me to labor , but to depend for subsistence on the labor of others .
" Children are not to be blamed for the faults of their parents .

The White House says President Bush will meet Thursday in Washington with Salva Kiir , a vice president in the national Sudanese government and the president of semi-autonomous southern Sudan .
A statement Tuesday said the two leaders will discuss implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that ended Sudan 's north-south civil war in 2005 .
The agreement has appeared increasingly shaky , especially since former southern rebels withdrew their ministers from the national government in Khartoum last month .
The Sudan People 's Liberation Movement has accused Khartoum of blocking implementation of the peace deal .
The former rebels are demanding withdrawal of northern troops and more control over the oil-producing Abiya region .
The White House says Mr. Bush and Mr. Kiir will also discuss efforts to bring peace to Sudan 's troubled Darfur region .
Peace talks in Libya last month made little progress as the chief Darfur rebel groups refused to attend .
Pro-Moscow officials in Chechnya say federal forces have killed a separatist leader believed to have been involved in a number of terrorist attacks .

Outgoing British Prime Minister Tony Blair has announced a new initiative for training Muslim clergy and boosting the study of moderate Islam in British colleges and universities .
Mr. Blair announced the government plan Monday at an Islamic conference in London .
He said he feared extremists could drown out what he called the " TRUE voice " of Islam .
The nearly $ 2 million initiative follows a government report that found Islamic studies in Britain focus broadly on conditions in the Middle East , while often failing to reflect the realities of Muslim life in Britain .
Mr. Blair also stressed that his decisions to back U.S.-led military actions in Afghanistan and Iraq had nothing to do with religion .
He said the religious faith of both countries was no more relevant to those decisions than to the decision his government took in the 1990s to support ethnic Albanian Muslims in Serbia 's embattled Kosovo province .

He also said the case is still under investigation .
Ashtiani is a 43-year-old mother of two who was first convicted in 2006 for having an " illicit relationship " with two men after the death of her husband the year before .
She was sentenced at the time to 99 lashes .
Later that year , she was also convicted of adultery and sentenced to be stoned , even though she retracted a confession that she says was made under duress .
